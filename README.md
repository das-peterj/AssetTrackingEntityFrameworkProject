# Asset Tracking with database and Entity Framework Core

This project is the start of an Asset Tracking database. Asset Tracking is a way to keep track of the company assets, like Laptops, Stationary computers, phones and so on... All assets have an end of life which for simplicity reasons is 3 years.  All assets needs to be stored in database using Entity Framework Core.
